Finally got React with Node.js working
Attempted to use node.js and react with mui
Will need to figure out how to set that up for everyone so that they can use mui
MUI did not work on my machine due to dependencies
Attempted to install dependencies
Will continue this next sprint

npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

dependencies
npm install react react-dom
react is one, but that should already be installed for everyone

styled components
npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components

mySQL queries on command line

Node.js is all backend
Node.js automatically sets up when use npm create-react-app test-app
While coding in react, it essentially holds up our server on a local host so that you can see what you are creating
Our plan is to use MUI with React for easy customization
